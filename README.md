# Tofino + P4: A Strong Compound for AQM on High-Speed Networks?

This repository contains the data plane and control plane implementations of our three variants of PIE for Tofino in P4<sub>16</sub>.
Note: The code has been tested with SDE-9.1.0.

### P4_16 Implementation

The P4_16 source code for our three PIE variants (PIE<sub>CP</sub>, PIE<sub>DP</sub>, and PIE<sub>TABLE</sub>) is located in ``p4src``.
On a high-level, the variants are captured in the corresponding files ``pie_(controlplane|dataplane|table.p4)``.

Our implementation is structured to reuse as much code as possible across the different variants.
This works in parts for PIE<sub>DP</sub> and PIE<sub>TABLE</sub> while PIE<sub>CP</sub> largely has an independent implementation.
The actual logic of our implementations is contained in the ``source-*.p4`` files. 

File | Pipeline Part | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
``source-types.p4`` | - | collects general type definitions (headers, etc.)
``source-ingress-dataplane-table.p4`` | Ingress | Ingress logic for PIE<sub>DP</sub> and PIE<sub>TABLE</sub>
``source-ingress-controlplane.p4`` | Ingress | Ingress logic for PIE<sub>CP</sub>
``source-egress-common-skeleton.p4`` | Egress | Common egress logic for PIE<sub>DP</sub> and PIE<sub>TABLE</sub>. <br> PIE<sub>DP</sub> /PIE<sub>TABLE</sub> fill out specific parts of the code.
``source-egress-dataplane.p4`` | Egress | Specific egress logic for PIE<sub>DP</sub> 
``source-egress-table.p4`` | Egress | Specific egress logic for PIE<sub>TABLE</sub>
``source-egress-controlplane`` | Egress | Egress logic for PIE<sub>CP</sub>
